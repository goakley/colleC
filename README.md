## Data Structures

### [Stack](http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/stack.html)

"A collection of items in which only the most recently added item may be removed. The latest added item is at the top. Basic operations are push and pop. Often top and isEmpty are available, too. Also known as "last-in, first-out" or LIFO."

### [Queue](http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/queue.html)

"A collection of items in which only the earliest added item may be accessed. Basic operations are add (to the tail) or enqueue and delete (from the head) or dequeue. Delete returns the item removed. Also known as "first-in, first-out" or FIFO."

### [SortedList](http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/sortedlist.html)

"A list whose items are kept sorted."
